## Schema (Model Definitions)

Refers to example JSON objects of each collection in the [db/json_examples.js](db/json_examples.js) file. The comments describe some rules for the fields.

## Database Setup & Sample Queries

This project uses MongoDB as the database. To use the database, install the required tools, clone this repository, navigate to this project's directory, and run the following commands in the terminal:

1. Tools required:

   - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) for the database server. By default, MongoDB runs on `localhost:27017`. Below commands assume this configuration.
   - [MongoDB Database Tools](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools) for importing and exporting data.
   - [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) for viewing the data in a user interface.

2. There are two ways to regenerate the sample database.

   1. Using mongorestore to load data from dump files.

      ```bash
      mongorestore db/dump/
      ```

   2. Using mongoimport to load data from each of the JSON files to a databases called `crm`. Change the file name to load different collections (Customer, Employee, Lead, Opportunity, Screening Record).

      ```bash
      mongoimport -d crm --jsonArray --file db/sample_data/[filename].json
      ```

3. To run the sample queries using node.js, use the following command. Change the query number to run different queries.

   ```bash
   node db/sample_queries/query1.js
   ```

## Web Application

The web application implements the Employee and Customer collections. It is built using Node.js and Express.js. To run the web application, clone this repository, navigate to the webapp directory, and run the following commands in the terminal:

1. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the web application.
